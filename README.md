# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

The purpose of the Bellybutton Biodiversity was to help Roza with the dashboard for bacteria from data collected from different volunteers from bacteria inside belly buttons. Different specimens were gathered and data was collected and quered. The sources used for the data collecgtion included HTML, JavaScript, and VSCode. From the images below, different participants are able to be chosen and demographic information would be displayed. This would show a breakdown of each volunteer and how their washing frequency determined the bacteria specimens in their belly buttons. A bar graph, horizontal graph, and a gauge chart were made. The bar chart showed the different bacteria specimens that were commonly found. The gauge chart showed the frequency of washing the bellybutton area per wee and the bubble chart revealed the samples from the bacteria. After all the data was collected, the results concluded that only a small amount of bacteria was found in the navel region with all the participants.
